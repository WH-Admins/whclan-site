          <p> Our real-time chatroom! Click the link at the bottom of this paragraph and join the discussion! There are already a lot of clan members hanging around here. <b>The best way</b> to use this is to <b>stay online</b> as long as you're near the computer; conversations can pick up spontaneously. We will also be using this for pre- and post- debriefings on scrim / practice days and clan meetings. If I'm anywhere near a computer, this is where you can contact me. </p>
