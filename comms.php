          <p> Our real-time chatroom! Put your altitude nick in the Nickname field and #wreaking under Channels, and join the discussion; there are already a lot of clan members hanging around here. (Desktop and mobile clients also available; we recommend hexchat for windows, XChat Azure for mac, AndChat for android, and weechat-cli for Linux.) <b>The best way</b> to use this is to <b>stay online</b> as long as you're near the computer; conversations usually pick up spontaneously. We've already had some good ones. We will also be using this for pre- and post- debriefings on scrim / practice days. If I'm anywhere near a computer, this is where you can contact me. </p>
