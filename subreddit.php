      <p class="important"> Reddit is an easy way to have discussions in communities of people. It will be taking the place of google groups in our clan. </p>
      <p> To use our subreddit effectively, log onto the channel whenever you're online in some way. Meet your teammates, ask questions, check out the new IRC bot I'm writing, or do whatever happens to become possible. </p>

        <p> If you don't already have an IRC account, this would be a great time to make one. Once you do, be sure to make a post in our roll call thread (on the top of the page) so we know who you are on reddit. </p>
