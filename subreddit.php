      <p class="important"> Reddit is an easy way to have discussions in communities of people. It will be taking the place of google groups in our clan. </p>
      <p> To use our subreddit effectively, make sure to check it every once and a while and don't shy away from making replies to posts or new topics about things you'd like to talk about. We're still getting the ball rolling, but it'll be great once we do. </p>

        <p> If you don't already have an reddit account, this would be a great time to make one. Once you do, be sure to make a post in our roll call thread (on the top of the page) so we know who you are on reddit. </p>
